    <h3>How to make Ratatoille</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the bottom and sides of a 1 Â½-quart casserole dish with 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant and golden brown. Add eggplant and parsley; cook and stir until eggplant is tender and soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Spread eggplant mixture evenly across the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. Spread zucchini in an even layer over top. Lightly salt and sprinkle with a little more cheese. Continue layering in this fashion, with tomatoes, mushrooms, onion, and bell pepper, covering each layer with a sprinkling of salt and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.</li>
